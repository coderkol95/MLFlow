# Sklearn
[X] Hyperparameter modification tracking via MLFlow projects
[X] Datset logging
[X] Comparison between different models and automatically obtaining the best model
[ ] MLProject setup
[X] Model registration with tags
[X] Serving the latest model from model registry
[ ] Model performance assessment on different slices of data
[ ] Staging vs production - Requires just changing the registered model details
[ ] Dockerization of training and serving env
